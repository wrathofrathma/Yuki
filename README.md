# Yuki

This is a game engine that I'm going to be programming over the course of a few weeks for my COSC482 Graphics class at Salisbury University. 
My goal is to make something that I can use for the remaining labs & project and help solidify my understanding of the work I've done this semester. 

## Information
#### Why Yuki?
I like snow and my only other real hobby is studying japanese, so I'm trying to mask my inability to think of creative names. It's also conveniently 4 letters, so namespaces don't need to be trimmed much at all.

#### Technologies used
SFML - Input & Window handling. Maybe down the line I'll use their sound class, but I haven't looked into it too much yet.
Bullet physics engine - We haven't started this yet in class, but I'm assuming I might want this.
OpenGL - Pretty much the bulk of the class.

## Outline
This is just a rough outline of what I need to complete.
[ ] Shader Class - To handle the loading and error checking of a shader & flag for use.
[ ] Graphics Engine - Child of sf::RenderWindow class. Will handle
[ ] Drawable - Top level Drawing class.
[ ] Ortho Camera
[ ] YPR Camera
[ ] Spherical Camera
[ ] User Input
[ ] Model & loading
[ ] Asset loader
